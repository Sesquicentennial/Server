# Server

Server-side API for the Sesquicentennial mobile apps, written in Node.js.

### Build Process

* `git clone https://github.com/sesquicentennial/server`
* If you don't already have Node:
  * `brew install node`
* `cd server/server/`
* `npm install`
* `nodemon server.js`
* The app should start and will be listening for requests on port 3000.  
* Try making a request (We recommend using Postman for testing)!
